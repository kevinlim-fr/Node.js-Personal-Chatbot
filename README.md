# Node.js-Personal-Chatbot
## Summary
The goal of this project is to describe my professional career through a Chatbot on Facebook Messenger Platform. Any person can ask questions about my skills, studies, career, professional experiences. The goal is to show my skills in an original way and to demonstrate my capabilities in creating a chatbot in Node.js.

## Frontend Client
The front-end client is Facebook Messenger, a messaging platform developed by Facebook. I chose to use this client because it is the most used messaging platform in the world. The integration with Wit.ai works well with that messaging platform.

## Backend Brain
The chatbot is based on a Node.js server. The server is responsible for the processing of the messages and intents provided by Messenger and Wit.ai. A case switch is implemented in the server to process an answer depending on the intent recognized.
